## 🛠️ Testing Infrastructure

### Test Environment Setup
```
Development Environment:
├── Jest configuration (jest.config.js)
├── React Testing Library setup (jest.setup.js)
├── Playwright configuration (playwright.config.ts)
├── Custom test utilities (tests/utils/)
└── Mock implementations (tests/__mocks__/)
```

### Continuous Integration Pipeline
```
GitHub Actions Workflow:
1. Code Quality (ESLint + TypeScript)
2. Security Scanning (npm audit + custom)
3. Unit Tests (Jest + RTL)
4. Integration Tests (Jest + RTL)
5. Build Verification
6. E2E Tests (Playwright - multi-browser)
7. Performance Tests (Lighthouse)
8. Accessibility Audits (axe-core)
9. Quality Gate Assessment
10. Deployment (if all pass)
```

### Test Data Management
